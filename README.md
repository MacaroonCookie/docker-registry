# Docker Registry Tool
A tool to search, modify, and interact with repositories on a private Docker Registry

I found that the features to interact with a private Docker Registry have been
incomplete and difficult to truly interact with. For example, hecking that my 
Docker images updated correctly with a private repository is a lengthy process
of calling multiple API endpoints. My desire is to have a command line tool to 
check the current status of repositories in a private registry, this project 
aims to fullfill this desire.
